         strong Blinkerize 
         | is a web app that transform your input: lines of vocabulary or any other textual information into fullscreen flashcards that are displayed randomly (or in order) in your browser window. 
       p After sign up each user gets his own URL (like 
         a(href='http://blinkerize.com/xyz123')  blinkerize.com/xyz123
         | ) where his vocabulary is displayed line by line; it can be customized in terms of font colors, size and delay between displaying another line.
       p The idea is simple: to surround yourself with your study material and get exposed to your Blinkerize vocabulary page as often as possible (for a second or two each time) while not interfering with your main daily activities. These single seconds build up into solid minutes of authentic learning each day.

         | Yes, you can make and use a local copy (e.g. on HDD) of your Blinkerize website. Go to your Blinkerize URL and save the current website on your disk as a HTML document. The local HTML file looks exactly the same and can be used instead its online version (as home page, new tab page or a screensaver) if you can't connect to our server for some reasons. Remember to update your offline version (just save the HTML file again) when you update your vocabulary online.
